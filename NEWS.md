# secuTrialR 1.3.2

* clear some notes and warnings in preparation for CRAN submission (#265)

# secuTrialR 1.3.1

* `build_secuTrial_url()` now has optional parameter `prefix` with default `"apps/WebObjects/"`. (#263)

# secuTrialR 1.3.0

* bug fix to read escaped enclosure characters in free text items, e.g. `\"` (#220, #261)
  * `read_export_options()` now also reads enclosure character from header
  * `.print.secuTrialoptions()` now also prints enclosure character. Quote and Tabulator are now printed as `'\"'` and `'\t'` rather than `'"'` and `'    '`. 
  * `read_export_table()` now uses `readr::read_delim()` with options `escape_backslash = TRUE` and `quote = export_options$quote`
* warning for ISO-8859 encoding moved from `read_export_table()` to `read_secuTrial_raw()` (one warning per export file instead of several warnings for each table)
* `read_export_options()` now reads only the first 10 lines to find the encoding. Reading all lines would fail if the export options were ISO-8859 encoded and contained 'problematic' characaters, e.g. in center names.
* Removed `encoding` option in `plot_recruitment()`: Not needed here, as centres are read with correct encoding in `read_secuTrial_raw()` and stored in the secuTrialR object.

# secuTrialR 1.2.0

* `write_secuTrial()` no longer allows `format = "sas"` due to deprecation of write_sas in `haven` (version 2.5.2).
* `read_secuTrial_raw` now produces a more explicit warning when ISO-8859 encoding is used. Recent changes in R seem to have reduced compatibility with this encoding.

# secuTrialR 0.7.1
* Fixed issue #116 on GitHub.

# secuTrialR 0.7.0

# secuTrialR 0.6.5

# secuTrialR 0.6.3
* Metadata variables are now also transformed to date and datetime formats, whenever appropriate.

# secuTrialR 0.6.2

# secuTrialR 0.6.1
* `return_random_cases()` has been added to the package. It allows to sample a random subset of cases from a secuTrial export in a reproducible fashion.

# secuTrialR 0.6.0
* `read_secuTrial_raw()` and `read_secuTrial()` no longer fail due to missing Add-ID, centre information or project setup in export data. Instead, adding of `pat_id` (no Add-ID), `centre` (no centre information) and `visit_name` (no project setup) to the data tables is now omitted if the relevant data for the operation is not available.

# secuTrialR 0.5.5
