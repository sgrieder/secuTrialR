\title{Compose a secuTrial URL}
\usage{
build_secuTrial_url(
  server,
  instance = NA,
  customer = NA,
  projid = NA,
  docid = NA,
  prefix = "apps/WebObjects/"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{server}{string containing a server URL}

\item{instance}{(optional) string containing secuTrial instance name}

\item{customer}{(optional) string containing secuTrial customer label}

\item{projid}{(optional) string containing secuTrial project identifier}

\item{docid}{(optional) secuTrial document/form identifer}

\item{prefix}{(optional) string containing the URL prefix to the WebObjects application (default: "apps/WebObjects/")}
}
\value{
string containing a URL to desired secuTrial page. Currently we provide no
        guarantee that the returned URL is valid.
}
\description{
Given a secuTrial server URL, and optionally instance, customer, project id and document id,
this function composes a URL to a specific secuTrial instance, customer or form.
}
\details{
To find the server and instance of a secuTrial database, simply extract the information from the URL that
you usually use to log in. For example in:

\emph{https://server.secutrial.com/apps/WebObjects/ST21-setup-DataCapture.woa/wa/choose?customer=TES}

\itemize{
\item server id is: \strong{server.secutrial.com}
\item instance id is: \strong{ST21-setup-DataCapture}
\item url prefix is: \strong{apps/WebObjects/}
\item you can find the customer id at the end of the link i.e \strong{TES}

      Alternatively it can be found in the
      CustomerAdminTool -> click "Kunden" -> Value in DB column of table on login page.
\item you can find the project id in the AdminTool -> Projects -> left side ID column in the table.
\item you can find docids in secuTrial exports as values in the "mnpdocid" column.

      Alternatively they are noted in the form footers of the DataCapture.
}

Also note that only the server address has to be provided, the other arguments are optional.
Thus, there are different scenarios:
\itemize{
\item if only server address is provided, the output will point to the secuTrial server
\item if secuTrial server and instance are provided, the output will point to the secuTrial instance.
\item if secutrial server, instance and customer id are provided, the output will point to the customer page.
\item if secuTrial server, instance, customer, project and document id are provided,
      the output will point to a specific secuTrial form.
}
}

# This example, builds pseudo-urls that do not point to an active secuTrial instance.

# return docids
